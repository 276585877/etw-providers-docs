# ETW Providers Docs

Windows provides the ETW framework for event tracing. The ETW framework comes with many built-in ETW providers, but
most of them are not documented very well. This repository aims to collect and document ETW providers. The main issue is 
extracting the specific fields of ETW provider events.
